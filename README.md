# Would You Rather App

This application lets a user view a series of questions posed
by other users, answer those questions, and submit questions of
their own. Also, a user can view statistics on the number and types
of answers to all questions, and they can see a ranked list of
the users based on the number of total questions each user has
asked and answered.
